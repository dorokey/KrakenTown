# KrakenTown
This game is supposed to be similar to the prototype developed in the seminar: as in, the player shoots at things falling down and is able to collect tokens.
Its just that there's enough Corona in my life already, so I wanted to change the setting, preferrably to something where I may be able to find fitting background pictures.
Also, I wanted the player to be allowed to go/fly/swim higher than just the edge of the game view screen, so I wanted an environment where that made sense aesthetically. I figured I could do something underwater, because then it can start with darker images and get lighter when the player gets closer towards the top of the ocean; so it signals the end. The player ended up being a Kraken 
( - and I guess also because subconciously I liked that start screen from GitKraken, but I didnt notice up until I liked the rest of it so much I didnt want to change it -)
because I figured that they have that ink-thing so it makes sense that they shoot at something. They end up shooting at plastic/other rubbish clogging the oceans because, ya know, the environment. 

In the game, going higher/upwards then was supposed to include reaching upper levels, but since I didnt want it to be that you can just straight up fly to the end; 
so there ended up being keys one needs to collect to be allowed to pass. Other collectibles are supposed to include: getting faster, getting coins for the highscore, getting more lives/protection, collecting items that allow you to shoot more powerfully.

If there is time left, I'd like to include fake items that look like the power-ups but instead of enhance, block the players powers/ability instead (so go slower, shoot slower, lose score points).
